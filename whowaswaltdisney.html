			<p class="description">
				<img id="walter" src="walterdisney.jpg" alt="Walter Elias Disney" width="137" height="205">Walter Elias Disney was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons and he co-founded the Walt Disney Company. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. (Wikipedia, 2018)

				Disney was a shy, and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public personality. He had high expectations of those that he worked with. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. (Wikipedia, 2018)

Disney attended McKinley High School in Chicago, where he took classes in the Arts and was a contributing cartoonist for the school paper. When Disney was 16, he dropped out of school to join the Army but was rejected for being underage. Instead, he joined the Red Cross and was sent to France for a year. He moved back to the U.S. in 1919. (Biography.com, 2017)
